# Deauthenticator DOS Attack Detector
This project provides a simple tool to detect deauthentication attacks on your Wi-Fi network. By analyzing the number of deauthentication packets captured, you can identify potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or deviations from normal network behavior.

This tool helps you assess whether the packet count suggests a potential DoS attack targeting connected devices.

## Getting Started
1. ### Prerequisites:
   - Python 2.7 or higher
   - Scapy module
2. ### Installation:
   - Clone the repository
   - Change to the project directory using cd deauth-detector
   - Run the tool

## Considerations:
- This tool acts as a preliminary detection mechanism. Further investigation might be necessary to confirm malicious intent.
- Be cautious of false positives caused by legitimate network activity or neighboring networks.

This is just a fun little project I made to learn more about network security. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback!
